          <p>At NoGhostHiring, we know that circumstances can change, and sometimes you may want to remove a report you’ve submitted. This page gives candidates a simple way to request the deletion of their ghosting report, while also protecting privacy and keeping the system reliable.</p> <p>Your trust matters to us, and so does the integrity of the data. That’s why every deletion request goes through a  verification process. This ensures that only valid reports are removed, protecting both candidates and the accuracy of the information others rely on.</p>
          <a href="https://app.nocodb.com/#/nc/form/38578c49-b421-4260-8ab8-bb625c385c9d" target="_blank">Deletion Request Form ↗</a>
          <h3>Verification Process</h3>
          <p>Once you submit a deletion request, our moderation team carefully reviews it to make sure it’s valid and handled responsibly. Every request goes through a manual check designed to protect both your privacy and the integrity of the platform. This review process includes:</p>
          <ul> <li>Confirming the request: We check that the details you provide match an actual report in our system. This includes the details you originally shared, like your name or alias, email, the company, and when you submitted the report.</li> <li>Maintaining accuracy: We review each request carefully to make sure that removing a report does not affect the overall accuracy, credibility, or transparency of the NoGhostHiring data.</li> <li>Preventing misuse: Reports are never deleted without proper verification. This protects the system from fraudulent or malicious attempts to change the record.</li> </ul>
          <p><p>After your request has been verified, we’ll send a confirmation email to the address you provided. The report will only be permanently deleted once you confirm through that email, ensuring the process is secure and intentional.</p></p>
          <h3>Important Notes</h3>
          <ul> <li>No unique IDs or logins: We don’t use personal accounts or login systems. Verification depends only on the information you provide, so it’s important that details are accurate and complete.</li> <li>Processing time: Every request is reviewed carefully and handled manually to protect the integrity of the system. Please allow time for verification and approval, as deletions cannot happen instantly.</li> <li>Protection for both sides: This process is built to safeguard both candidates and companies, ensuring fairness, anonymity, and accountability for everyone involved.</li> <li>Company requests: Companies cannot remove reports through this page. If you represent an organization and have transparency concerns or sensitive issues to raise, please visit our <a href="transparency.html">Transparency Page</a> for the correct process.</li> <li>Audit trail: All deletion requests, along with related communication and actions, are logged internally to ensure accountability and prevent misuse of this system.</li> </ul>
          <p>Companies cannot directly request deletion here; for concerns about transparency or sensitive information, please refer to our <a href="transparency.html">Transparency Page.</a></p>
