        <p>NoGhostHiring is a global, community-driven platform designed to bring transparency to hiring and recruitment. It collects anonymized candidate experiences and turns them into aggregated insights that anyone can access. The project is open to all and is not limited by geography, audience, or legal framework. By using NoGhostHiring, you agree to these Terms and to the principles outlined in our <a href="disclaimer.html" target="_blank">Disclaimer</a>, <a href="privacy.html" target="_blank">Privacy & Third Parties</a>, <a href="donotsell.html" target="_blank">Do Not Sell Policy</a>, and <a href="cookies.html" target="_blank">Cookies Policy</a>. This Legal Policy page is not meant to assert control. Its purpose is to clarify rights, responsibilities, and limitations in a space where openness, fairness, and transparency are the core values.</p>
        <h3>Nature of Service</h3>
        <p>NoGhostHiring turns experiences reported by candidates into structured data and meaningful insights. The platform is informational, not accusatory. It is not an employment service, a recruitment marketplace, or a verification authority. What we share are community-driven signals designed to help participants see patterns and trends. The platform exists in the public space: part collective memory, part accountability tool, and part open dataset.</p>
        <h3>Transparency Is Not Defamation</h3>
        <p>Publishing anonymized reports, aggregated scores, and structured data is not meant to declare guilt or prove a fact. It reflects the experiences shared by the community, carefully moderated for safety, fairness, and clarity. Transparency is about public insight and accountability. Defamation requires falsehood and malicious intent, and NoGhostHiring is a neutral platform where candidate reports and company clarifications can exist side by side. Readers are encouraged to interpret the information responsibly and thoughtfully.</p>
        <h3>Use of Company Names, References, and URLs</h3>
        <p>NoGhostHiring may mention organizations by their public names, domains, or other common identifiers. These references are purely for identification, comparison, and fair comment. We do not suggest endorsement, affiliation, or ownership of any of these names. All trademarks remain the property of their rightful owners. Logos, branding, or other assets are used only where the law allows nominative or descriptive reference. This is considered fair use and fair comment, and in some places it is recognized as “fair dealing,” which allows public reference for informational purposes.</p>
        <h3>User Submissions and License</h3>
        <p>By contributing to Ghost Score through NoGhostHiring, candidates confirm that their reports honestly reflect their experiences and do not include confidential trade secrets or personal data from third parties. All submissions are anonymized and moderated. By submitting a report, you grant NoGhostHiring a global, perpetual license to host, display, transform, aggregate, and republish the content for the purpose of transparency. Submissions may be retained in anonymized form even if later withdrawn, to preserve the continuity of the dataset. You retain ownership of your original words, while Ghost Score holds only the rights to use anonymized and aggregated versions of your submission.</p>
        <h3>Candidate Rights: Safety, Anonymity, and Moderation</h3>
        <p>NoGhostHiring protects anonymity by default. Personal details like names, emails, and contact information are never shown in public data. Recruiter names, when included, are partially masked so patterns can be recognized without revealing identities. All reports go through automated checks and human review to prevent abuse, spam, or unsafe disclosures. Moderators may redact, edit, or reject reports to ensure safety, clarity, and compliance with our policies. If a candidate notices sensitive information that was shared by mistake, they can request its removal by contacting the platform.</p>
        <h3>Company Rights: Clarifications, Replies, and Context</h3>
        <p>Organizations have the right to provide clarifications, updates, or responses. Once verified, these statements can be published alongside candidate reports, creating balance and allowing dialogue. Companies can request a review of content they believe misrepresents context or infringes on their rights. Candidate submissions remain unchanged to preserve integrity, but clarifications are displayed openly so both voices are heard. NoGhostHiring does not erase history, but it allows context to grow and evolve over time.</p>
        <h3>Takedown Requests & Sensitive Content</h3>
        <p>Companies can request the removal of reports only if they include sensitive or confidential information that has nothing to do with the candidate experience. Each request is carefully reviewed under our fairness and moderation policy. Requests aimed at removing criticism or negative feedback will not be approved, because our mission is built on transparency and fair use.</p>
        <h3>Moderation Principles</h3>
        <p>NoGhostHiring uses a combination of automated checks and human review. The goal is not to censor, but to keep the platform safe and the content meaningful. Reports may be restricted if they contain harassment, hate, personal information, spam, unlawful disclosures, or anything unrelated to recruitment experiences. Moderation is handled transparently, and both candidates and companies can ask questions or appeal decisions whenever possible.</p>
        <h3>Accuracy and Disclaimers</h3>
        <p>Ghost Score does not promise complete accuracy, full coverage, or up-to-the-minute information. Each submission reflects a candidate’s personal perspective. The aggregated scores and insights are statistical reflections, not definitive judgments. All public outputs are provided as-is, without any guarantees. Readers should view Ghost Score as one tool for understanding hiring patterns, not as absolute fact.</p>
        <h3>Liability Limitations</h3>
        <p>NoGhostHiring, along with Ghost Score, its contributors, and maintainers, is not responsible for any damages that may result from using the platform, its data, or relying on its content. This includes direct or indirect losses, incidental or consequential harm, or reputational impact, including lost profits, goodwill, or missed opportunities. Use Ghost Score as a source of perspective and insight, but not as a substitute for your own research, professional judgment, or legal advice. Use the platform at your own discretion.</p>
        <h3>Rights of Usage and Dataset Licensing</h3>
        <p>NoGhostHiring’s Ghost Score datasets are fully anonymized and only available in aggregate. Public JSON feeds are provided for research, journalism, and public interest purposes. You are welcome to reference, analyze, and republish work derived from these datasets, as long as proper attribution is given and the data is not re-identified, misrepresented, or used in ways that could cause harm. Any commercial use requires explicit permission. Attempting to identify individuals or misuse the data is strictly prohibited.</p>
        <h3>Company Names & Fair Use</h3>
        <p>Company names, recruiter identifiers, and related URLs may appear within Ghost Score only to provide commentary, reporting, and transparency. We do not claim ownership of company trademarks, logos, or brand assets. All usage is nominative and consistent with fair-use principles. Companies retain full rights to their intellectual property outside of this transparency project.</p>
        <h3>Responsible Use of Data</h3>
        <p>Ghost Score data is never meant to be used for harassment, retaliation, discrimination, or any kind of punitive blacklist against companies or individuals. Its purpose is to inform candidates and encourage open dialogue. Any misuse of the platform or its data for harmful actions goes against its intent and is the responsibility of the person taking those actions. If you have concerns or need to discuss an issue, the only point of contact is the email provided, where conversations can be scheduled directly.</p>
        <h3>Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p>The Ghost Score algorithm, the design of NoGhostHiring, and all the insights generated on the site are original works protected under global copyright and related laws. Reports and submissions remain the property of the candidates who created them, while NoGhostHiring retains the right to host and aggregate the information. Any external tools or libraries we use, such as Bootstrap, remain under their own open-source licenses.</p>
        <h3>Prohibited Conduct</h3>
        <p>Users may not try to reveal the identities of others, submit false or harmful information, share confidential third-party data, harass anyone, disrupt the site, or use Ghost Score results for discrimination or other harmful purposes. Excessive automated scraping, republishing data without proper credit, or trying to repurpose the dataset for surveillance is also not allowed. NoGhostHiring exists to promote transparency and improve hiring, not for exploitation or misuse.</p>
        <h3>Security and Hosting</h3>
        <p>NoGhostHiring operates as a static site with backend moderation and minimal data handling. Basic logs and analytics are used only to protect the site, monitor performance, and understand trends in the aggregate. There is no hidden tracking, profiling, or intrusive surveillance. While security measures are in place to maintain integrity, no system is completely foolproof, and using the site means you acknowledge that reality.</p>
        <h3>Advertising and Revenue</h3>
        <p>If you have a concern or dispute, we ask that you first reach out to NoGhostHiring with the details. We prioritize dialogue and resolution over escalation. If a dispute cannot be resolved informally, it will be reviewed in good faith, guided by best practices for the global commons and the internet. No single jurisdiction governs NoGhostHiring; it is intended as a shared resource. Possible remedies include clarifications, removal of specific content, or corrections to the dataset, but financial compensation is not provided.</p>
        <h3>Regional Compliance</h3>
        <p>NoGhostHiring recognizes that users come from different countries, each with its own privacy, speech, and consumer rights protections. Where regional rules apply, such as GDPR or CCPA, we follow their spirit by anonymizing data, minimizing what we collect, and respecting consent. At the same time, NoGhostHiring is an independent global platform and cannot fully comply with every local law at once. By using the platform, users agree to engage under these universal terms.</p>
        <h3>Jurisdiction & Global Use</h3>
        <p>NoGhostHiring exists in the digital commons as a global transparency project. It is not tied to any single country or regulatory system. Users are responsible for following the laws that apply where they live. By participating, you acknowledge that NoGhostHiring is a fair-use, commentary-driven platform, not a formal adjudicatory body. Transparency does not mean defamation, and contributing is always voluntary.</p>
        <h3>No Waiver of Freedoms</h3>
        <p>NoGhostHiring is built on the principles of the open internet: encouraging speech while acting responsibly, promoting transparency while protecting privacy, and fostering accountability without surveillance. Participation on this platform is completely voluntary. Nothing in these Terms limits the rights you already have under international human rights or free expression protections.</p>
        <h3>Data Use Policy</h3>
        <p>NoGhostHiring provides anonymized JSON data to promote transparency and support research. This dataset can be used for analysis, commentary, or journalistic reporting under fair use, and attribution is required. Users may not try to identify individuals, resell or redistribute raw datasets, or use the data to target or harass anyone. Breaking these rules may result in restricted access to the data.</p>
        <h3>Entirety and Evolution</h3>
        <p>This Legal page, along with our other linked policies, sets the understanding between NoGhostHiring and its community. It is not a rigid contract, but a living framework that evolves as the platform grows and the community develops. Using the site after any updates means you agree to the revised framework.</p>
        <h3>Closing Statement</h3>
        <p>NoGhostHiring is not a courtroom. It is a mirror that reflects experiences, patterns, and voices that often go unseen. This platform belongs to the community, not to any single company or individual. By participating here, you are part of a shared effort to create openness, fairness, and collective accountability in hiring.</p>
