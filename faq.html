              <div class="accordion-body">NoGhostHiring is a structured way to measure how companies engage with candidates throughout the hiring process. It takes candidate-reported experiences and turns them into a clear, standardized scale that reflects both how often ghosting happens and how severe it is. Unlike traditional review sites, it is not an opinion poll, a star rating, or a collection of anecdotes. It is a carefully calculated signal built from verified reports, patterns, and statistical aggregation. Every report contributes to the overall score while keeping candidate identities anonymous and ensuring fairness. The goal is simple: give candidates visibility into hiring practices so they can make informed decisions, and provide companies with meaningful feedback they can act on.</div>

              <div class="accordion-body">Traditional review platforms are not built to track how candidates are treated. Sites like Glassdoor mix workplace culture, compensation, and personal grievances, often without clear structure, context, or normalization for recruitment experiences. A single extreme review can skew perception, and free-text reviews make it hard to compare experiences in a meaningful way. These platforms focus on long-term employment, while ghosting happens over short hiring windows and requires precise, structured measurement. NoGhostHiring was created to address these gaps, offering a dedicated and transparent view of how candidates are treated throughout the hiring process.</div>

              <div class="accordion-body">The algorithm behind NoGhostHiring is proprietary and runs on a secure cloud-based system to protect data, bandwidth, and infrastructure. It doesn’t just add up points. Instead, it considers structured report inputs, historical patterns, credibility of submissions, and statistical trends. Each report is evaluated for consistency, alignment with other reports, and severity, while ensuring that extreme outliers do not skew the results. Automated filters catch spam, AI-generated content, malicious submissions, and venting that could bias the score. Human moderators also review reports to make sure only high-quality entries influence the algorithm. All reports are anonymized, and the system is probabilistic, adapting as new data comes in. Updates and improvements are shared on Discord, giving the community transparency into how the algorithm evolves without exposing sensitive details or risking manipulation.</div>

              <div class="accordion-body">NoGhostHiring uses a layered approach to moderation. Automated scripts first filter submissions for spam, AI-generated content, or any attempts to identify candidates indirectly. Human moderators review reports daily to ensure quality, maintain anonymity, and remove anything that could put candidates or companies at risk. This process prevents rushed submissions from entering the system and helps preserve the integrity of the data before it is used in the algorithm. Because all submissions are anonymized, we cannot verify individual identities, so moderation focuses on content quality and adherence to our guidelines. Candidates may notice a short processing delay while moderation is completed, and this careful review helps keep the platform safe, trustworthy, and credible.</div>
