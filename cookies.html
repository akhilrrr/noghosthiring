      <div class="internal-para">
        <p>This Cookies Policy explains how NoGhostHiring uses cookies and similar technologies on our site. Because the site is hosted as a static front end through GitHub Pages, we keep tracking to a minimum. The cookies we use are limited to making sure the site runs smoothly, remembering basic preferences, and helping us understand how visitors use the site so we can improve it. We do not sell your data, we do not run intrusive tracking, and we never allow third parties to use cookies to collect candidate reports or personal information.</p>
        <h3>What cookies are and how we use them</h3>
        <p>Cookies are small text files that your browser stores on your device. Some disappear when you close the browser (session cookies), while others stay for a set period of time (persistent cookies). We may also use modern storage tools like localStorage or sessionStorage, but for simplicity, we call all of these “Cookies”. On NoGhostHiring, cookies are used only for a few clear purposes: to keep the site running smoothly and remember basic preferences, to collect anonymous analytics that help us understand traffic and improve usability, and if we ever add advertising in the future, it will be brand-safe, non-intrusive, and never tied to your reports or identity.</p>
        <h3>First-party vs third-party cookies</h3>
        <p>First-party cookies are set by the NoGhostHiring domain and are generally used to support essential functions or remember your preferences. Third-party cookies may come from services we use, such as analytics or, in the future, advertising. Since this is a static site, NoGhostHiring itself uses very few, if any, first-party cookies. Most of the cookies you’ll see come from analytics providers, and these are configured so they don’t collect personally identifiable information. If we ever introduce display ads, the providers may set their own cookies, but these will be limited to basic ad delivery and carefully capped to prevent intrusive tracking.</p>
        <h3>Essential operation and preferences</h3>
        <p>NoGhostHiring is a static site, so it doesn’t rely on complex session management. In a few cases, we may use a small cookie or a localStorage entry to remember things like your preferred view, a banner you’ve dismissed, or the language you selected. These settings exist only to make the site feel smoother and more consistent for you. They don’t identify who you are, and if you choose to block them, almost everything on the site will still work just fine.</p>
        <h3>Analytics and measurement</h3>
        <p>We use privacy-conscious setups of Google Analytics and Microsoft Clarity to better understand how people use the site, improve navigation, identify broken pages, and decide which features to focus on. The data we collect is limited to broad events like pages visited, time spent on a page, device type, and general location at a coarse level based on IP. We do not track candidate names, emails, recruiter identities, or the content of reports. Wherever possible, we configure these tools to reduce data collection, avoid storing detailed IP addresses, and prevent sharing with third parties. The goal is simple: analytics help us see which parts of the site need fixing or improving, not to create behavioral profiles of individual candidates.</p>
        <h3>Session replay and masking (Clarity)</h3>
        <p>If session replay is enabled through Microsoft Clarity, it is used only to study overall interaction patterns, like whether people scroll to important sections or run into layout issues. Areas that could contain personal or sensitive information are masked or excluded by default. Candidate reports, email addresses, and recruiter names are never captured or sent through session replay tools.</p>
        <h3>Advertising cookies (future state)</h3>
        <p>To help cover the costs of hosting and moderation, we may at some point include simple display advertising, such as Google AdSense. If this happens, cookies may be used to limit how often ads appear, measure performance, and maintain brand safety. Your candidate reports or personal details will never be used to target ads, and your submissions will never be treated as advertising signals. Should we introduce advertising, this policy will be updated in advance, and where required by law, you will see a clear consent prompt before any ad cookies are set.</p>
        <h3>No creepy tracking, no sale of data</h3>
        <p>NoGhostHiring keeps things simple and respectful. We never sell your personal information or hand it over to data brokers. We don’t use cookies to track you across different sites, and we don’t run ads that follow you around. Any data we share is collective and anonymous, focused only on company-level insights, never tied back to you as an individual.</p>
        <h3>Hosting, logs, and infrastructure signals</h3>
        <p>While the site runs on a static setup, our hosting provider and its content delivery network may generate standard server logs for security and reliability. These logs can include details like IP addresses, request times, user agents, and referrers. Their purpose is to protect the site from abuse and to help troubleshoot any availability issues. They are technical byproducts of keeping the site online, not marketing tools, and they are never used to identify candidates or connect submissions to browsing activity</p>
        <h3>Consent, control, and your choices</h3>
        <p>You’re in control of cookies. Most browsers let you block or delete them, clear storage, or send a “Do Not Track” signal. If your browser or extension sends a Global Privacy Control signal, we’ll treat it as an opt-out of sale, sharing, and targeted ads. Blocking analytics cookies won’t stop the site from working, but it does limit our ability to understand how people use it and where we can make improvements.</p>
        <h3>Managing cookies in your browser</h3>
        <p>You have full control over how cookies work in your browser. At any time, you can adjust or turn them off through your browser’s privacy settings. Clearing cookies and site data will remove things like saved preferences and analytics identifiers. If you don’t want Google Analytics to track you, you can install Google’s official opt-out add-on. If you’d rather not allow session replay, you can block the Clarity domain with your content blocker or turn off third-party cookies completely. All of these options are in your hands, and the site will still work even if you choose to disable them.</p>
        <h3>Lawful bases and regional compliance</h3>
        <p>Where required by law, we handle cookies and personal data with care. In the EU and EEA under GDPR, essential cookies are used on the basis of legitimate interest or contractual necessity, while analytics and advertising cookies are only used with consent. In California under CCPA and CPRA, we do not sell personal information. If we introduce advertising partners in the future, you will see a clear “Do Not Sell or Share” option, and we will honor Global Privacy Control signals. In other regions with similar laws such as LGPD or PDPA, we apply the same approach: collect the minimum data needed, store it securely, ask for consent where required, and make opting out simple everywhere.</p>
        <h3>Children’s privacy</h3>
        <p>NoGhostHiring is meant for adults who are actively seeking jobs, not for children. We do not knowingly use cookies or other tools to profile minors. If you believe a child has engaged with the site in a way that raises a privacy concern, please reach out to us. We will review the situation and take appropriate action, including removing any non-essential identifiers.</p>
        <h3>Data retention and security</h3>
        <p>Our analytics partners keep cookie identifiers and related event data only for their standard retention periods, after which the data is either deleted or aggregated. We never share candidate identities with analytics tools, and we do not link analytics identifiers to report submissions. Access to analytics dashboards is limited to authorized team members, and we regularly review settings to ensure we keep the data footprint as small as possible.</p>
        <h3>Changes to this policy</h3>
        <p>We may update this Cookies Policy from time to time to reflect product updates, changes in the law, or improvements in best practices. If we make significant changes, such as adding advertising or introducing new analytics features, we will clearly highlight them here. Where required, we will also ask for your consent again before placing any new cookies.</p>
        <h3>Contact</h3>
        <p>If you have questions about cookies, privacy settings, or this policy, you can reach us at hello@noghosthiring.com. If your request relates to privacy rights in a specific region, please include your location so we can make sure it’s handled under the right legal guidelines.</p>
