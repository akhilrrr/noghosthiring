Apparently Goldman is well known in the industry to drag out interviews and then ghost, and maybe suddenly offer like after 4 months. I said I would apply again because it is interview practice in this market. But if you have a good employer maybe not worth the effort",

      "Mathew from this so-called “India’s biggest UX agency” calls me up, says the CEO himself wants to meet me for an interview. Naturally, I thought this sounded promising - I mean, how often does a CEO get involved directly unless they’re serious?\n\nWe meet, talk projects, and everything feels good. Then he drops the “small task” on me. The condition? It should be a problem-focused case study with proper user research, not just pretty visuals. Fine, fair enough. I spend my weekend doing exactly that - 12–13 pages of research, process, strategy, and, on top of that, 5 fully designed mobile screens to tie it together. I submit it on time.\n\nAnd then? Silence. Not even a “got it.” Days pass. I follow up, even cc the CEO. Finally, Mathew calls me back - not to acknowledge the work, but to ask why there are “only 5 screens.” Apparently, the CEO now wants more screens to “analyze my UI skills.”\n\nExcuse me? Wasn’t the assignment supposed to be about research and problem-solving? I literally gave you the exact thing you asked for, with fully designed flows on top. But no, now it’s suddenly about cranking out more mockups because 5 polished screens apparently don’t count. So I asked him directly: If I do this extra work, can you at least confirm that I’ll be in the actual hiring pipeline? Guess what - dead silence. I asked again, cc’d the CEO this time. Still nothing.\n\nAt this point, it’s painfully obvious. This wasn’t hiring, this was fishing for free design work under the guise of an “assignment.” An agency with that kind of reputation bragging as “India’s biggest UX agency,” yet operating like a cheap design-sweatshop scam. Honestly, if that’s their process, they don’t deserve any designer’s respect."

      "This was the worst ghosting experience I’ve ever had. The recruiter gave me all the positive signals, even pushed urgency, and then made me do an entire app design - 4–5 screens, a detailed case study, plus user research. I spent over 6 hours on it and submitted everything on time.\n\nIt started with a call from HR, then multiple follow-ups from another HR, Konika. The role and package seemed like a fit, and they kept stressing urgency. After I submitted, silence. A week later, HR apologized for the delay, saying the team lead was on holiday. Then… nothing again.\n\nI followed up multiple times with no response. Over a month later, the first HR randomly called again, asking if I was still open, the call ended awkwardly, almost like a wrong dial. A week later, she messaged me on WhatsApp apologizing for the delay because she’d been on her wedding holiday.\n\nIt’s now been 40+ days, and I’ve received no acknowledgment, no rejection, not even clarity on next steps. I’m confident my work wasn’t the issue - this is just a disorganized and unprofessional process.\n\nIf you’re applying to ShyftLabs, beware of the “urgency” they project. From what I’ve since heard in designer and developer circles, ghosting candidates is a pattern there. To whoever’s in charge of hiring: a simple automated acknowledgment, or basic communication about delays, would save candidates time and your reputation. Right now, it just feels shady and disrespectful."

      "I applied for a part-time UX/UI designer role, and they set up an interview. Sounds straightforward, right? Instead, I walk into a panel of three people, and the whole thing immediately goes off the rails.\n\nOne guy spends 30 minutes grilling me on React and JavaScript. This is a design role, but apparently, I had to explain the basics of hex codes in CSS, React modules, Redux, and all sorts of frontend trivia. Like, what exactly does this have to do with the JD you posted? If you wanted a frontend dev, you should’ve said so. And mind you, I actually have worked with React and frontend — but that’s not the point. You don’t bait designers with a part-time design role and then run a pop quiz like it’s a full-stack developer interview.\n\nIt didn’t end there. They also made me work on a website design project. I put in the effort, designed it, sent it across - and guess what? Total radio silence. Not even a “thanks, got it.” Two weeks later, after I followed up, the HR casually tells me I’m not in their pipeline anymore. That’s it. No explanation, no acknowledgment, nothing.\n\nSo yeah - bait, switch, and ghost. Classic time-wasting suckers."

Once I had done the task, the guy who I spoke to never responded. I asked if he had three days after and he said yes. After that, I heard nothing. I tried to call his number and nothing. Two weeks after, I even instagrammed the brand and they fobbed me off for over a week. Then the week after that he emailed saying he had hired someone else. So wasn’t even willing to give me the proposed interview. Sounds like they already hired and wanted free work ideas."

They asked me to submit the prototype and Figma file on a particular date, and i did that, respecting the deadline. They told me that they would schedule a round soon to discuss my thought process, so i even prepared a presentation to walk them through everything, but that round was never scheduled. I followed up and got a rejection email instead, which was very frustrating."

      "This is the story of being double ghosted.\n\nPraneetha, the HR, called me first - super urgent tone, made it sound like they needed me yesterday. Package looked good, I was hopeful. First round was with a “senior designer” who fired off what felt like ChatGPT-generated questions. I managed it, showed my portfolio, he seemed impressed.\n\nThen came the assignment. Full app design + case study over a weekend. I delivered. A week later, Praneetha finally acknowledged it. Eventually, they set up a call with the “big UX manager.” I expected strategy talk, but nope - he hit me with textbook trivia: primary colors, Fitts’s law, contrast ratios. Felt like a school quiz, not a design interview. Still, I handled it.\n\nWeeks passed. I asked if I was still in the process - Praneetha emailed saying they’d moved forward with someone else. Fine. But then, two weeks after rejecting me, she calls back to check if I’m still available. I said yes. And guess what? She vanished. Again.\n\nWhat’s wrong with these people? Wasting candidates’ time with fake urgency, school-level questions, and zero respect for the effort."

Last Friday I noticed the job advert reposted on their website with not 1 but 2 jobs on offer, a permanent job and a fixed term. I was absolutely furious to see what they had done behind my back with no regard to telling me I was unsuccessful.\n\nI have raised a formal complaint and awaiting response from senior HR.\n\nI think it is disgusting."

Post that I did a whiteboard assignment and was later asked to finalize the UI for the screens I went with during the assignment. I refused as it made no sense. They agreed and said I'll be interviewed by the founder as the last step. I later got a call telling me they've frozen the hiring."

      "The first interview was very normal, a bit of a technical screener but not too thorough as I was told that would come along in the next one or two interviews and the interviewer is kind and professional.\n\nThe second interview was so unprofessional it was bizarre. The interviewer mentioned my name was similar to a personal connection he no longer spoke to, was very cold in his questioning, admitted he did not read my resume and was not \"good at reading resumes\" but wanted me to explain my work and success so I did just that, only for him to say \"I didn't hear xyz\" so I'd explain how those were covered under umbrella terms like research and proceeded to go into higher detail. We had some strange interactions where his sound started cutting in and out and he commented \"what's wrong with your face?\" because I was squinting as I tried to hear him... just bizarre. His expressions always sided on negative or critical despite him saying he did very little to prepare.\n\nI thanked him for the interview despite the negative vibes a day or two later but never heard back, about a week or two after hearing nothing, not even an acknowledgement of time spent I assumed nothing would come of the conversation. I did reach back out to the first interviewer but also nothing."

      "After the first interview, which I walked to the store to inquire about, the manager (heath, ohio) told me to return the following day at a set time. I did. Only to be told how she texted me, which was a lie, stag for me to retinturn again for paperwork giving me the exuse they were short staffed, unprepared, call offs, etc that she would contact me to let me know when. Never happened. So I go back to follow up a third time only to be told by the young teenage cashier to come back later, while the same manager couldnt bother to come out the kitchen and tell me directly. I didnt say anything and left. This was a week later. So basically 3 times I made myself known on my own will, no communication from anybody, kept receiving the same run around exuse. Finally just accepted it and gave up. I'm not going to continue to beg regardless how bad I need a job, after being told she would have the paperwork ready a week prior. I'm an older fella so I refuse to be treated that way. Utter nonsense and very unprofessional"

      "Carolyn Komminsk, a recruiter at Onward Search, called me and also messaged on LI about a position I applied for. She thought I was qualified enough and wanted to ask me some questions and then do an initial video interview. She used an AI notetaker/screener during the first official interview. There was a lingering question about location of the job, whether it would be in my city or involve some travel or commuting. She promised to get back to me that week with an answer and to move forward in the interview process. After that interview, she never responded to email, voicemail, or LinkedIn. I never received a single message or call about the job again."

However, one thing that stuck to me during the whole interview process was them (the team Manager) constantly asking me if i really wanted the position, and to write them an email if i really do want it, even if i said it in person to them that i want this job. Sent them an Email 2 days after in person interview, no response at all, they actually told me in person to expect an answer after 2 weeks, but there was nothing. I emailed them again (personal email, not HR) exactly a  month after the interview, asking about their decision. Again i received no reply, but the next day i was sent an AI rejection Email instead."
